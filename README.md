    "question": "Solve: 2x + 3 = 7",
    "subject": "algebra",
    "context": {
        "learning_history": [...],
        "current_level": "high_school",
        "weak_areas": ["equation_solving"]
    }
}

# Response: AI Engine → Core Backend
{
    "response": {
        "answer": "x = 2",
        "explanation": "Step-by-step reasoning...",
        "teaching_points": [...],
        "follow_up_questions": [...]
    },
    "learning_analysis": {
        "concepts_reinforced": ["linear_equations"],

### Chain-of-Thought Implementation
```python
class EducationalReasoningAgent:
    def process_question(self, question, student_context):
        # 1. Problem Analysis
        problem_type = self.analyze_problem_structure(question)
        
        # 2. Educational Approach Selection
        teaching_method = self.select_pedagogy(problem_type, student_context)
        
        # 3. Step-by-Step Reasoning
        reasoning_chain = self.generate_reasoning_steps(question, teaching_method)
